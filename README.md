# AWS Key Aspects

## Security Best Practices
### Use IAM Roles & Policies Properly
- Principle of Least Privilege: Assign the minimum required permissions.
- Use IAM roles instead of IAM users wherever possible
- Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for root and IAM users.

### Secure Your Credentials
- Never hardcode AWS Credentials in code!
- Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for API keys & Credentials
- Use .env files but ensure they are added to .gitignore

### Enable AWS Security Features
- AWS GuardDuty: Detects suspicious activities.
- AWS Shield: Protects against DDoS attacks.
- AWS WAF: Protects applications from malicious requests.
- AWS Inspector: Scans EC2 instances for vulnerabilities.

### Encryption & Data Security
- Use AWS KMS for key management.
- Enable encryption at rest (S3, RDS, EBS, etc.).
- Enable encryption in transit using SSL/TLS.

## Cost Optimization
### Use AWS Cost Explorer & Budgets
- Set up AWS Budgets to avoid unexpected charges.
- Use Cost Explorer to monitor usage and reduce waste.
### Choose the Right EC2 Intance Type
- Use Spot Instances for non-critical workloads.
- Use Reserved Instances for long-term workloads.
- Use AWS Auto Scaling to adjust instances dynamically.
### Optimize Storage Costs
- Use S3 Lifecycle Policies to move old data to Glacier.
- Use EBS snapshots efficiently to avoid unnecessary costs.
- Enable Intelligent Tiering for S3 to reduce costs automatically.
### Use Serverless for Cost Efficiency
- Use AWS Lambda instead of EC2 for short-running processes.
- Use Fargate instead of full-fledged ECS clusters if possible.


## Performance & Scalability
### Use Load Balancing & Auto Scaling
### Optimize Databases for Performance
### Use AWS Global Accelerator & CloudFront

## Reliability & Monitoring
### Set Up Logging & Monitoring
- Enable AWS CloudWatch for logs & metrics.
- Use AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to track API calls and changes.
### Backup & Disaster Recovery
- Enable Automated Backups in RDS & EBS snapshots.
- Use Multi-AZ Deployment for high availability.
- Implement AWS Backup for centralized backup management.
### Use AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Regularly review your infrastructure using AWS Well-Architected Tool.

## Networking & Security Groups
### VPC Best Practices
- Use multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
- Keep databases and backend services in private subnets.
- Use NAT Gateway to allow outgoing internet access for private subnets.
### Security Groups & Firewalls
- Always restrict SSH (port 22) access to trusted IPs.
- Use security groups instead of allowing all traffic (0.0.0.0/0).
- Use AWS WAF to protect against SQL injection and XSS attacks.


## Best Practices for Difference AWS Services
### For Compute (EC2, Lambda, ECS, Fargate)
- Use Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) for EC2 instances.
- Use ECS with Fargate for better containerized application management.
- Prefer AWS Lambda for event-driven, small workloads.
### For Storage (S3, EFS, EBS)
- Use S3 with lifecycle rules to move old data to Glacier.
- Use EFS for shared storage across multiple EC2 instances.
- Use EBS snapshots for quick backups and disaster recovery.
### For Database (RDS, DynamoDB, ElasticCache)
- Use RDS Multi-AZ for high availability.
- Use DynamoDB Global Tables for global applications.
- Use ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached) to speed up read-heavy applications.
### For CI/CD & Deployment
- Use AWS CodePipeline for automated CI/CD.
- Use AWS CodeDeploy to deploy to EC2, Lambda, or ECS.
- Use Terraform or CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
